  - [Multiplication](https://github.com/nguyentuanvn/Algorithm/blob/master/1.1_Multiplication.cpp) by C++
- Week 2:
  - [1.2_IntegerArray.txt](https://github.com/nguyentuanvn/Algorithm/blob/master/1.2_IntegerArray.txt) contains all of the 100,000 integers between 1 and 100,000 (inclusive) in some order, with no integer repeated.
Your task is to compute the number of inversions in the file given, where the ith row of the file indicates the ith entry of an array.
  - [CountInversion](https://github.com/nguyentuanvn/Algorithm/blob/master/1.2_CountInversion.cpp) by C++

- Week 3:
  - [1.3_quicksort.txt](https://github.com/nguyentuanvn/Algorithm/blob/master/1.3_quicksort.txt) contains all of the integers between 1 and 10,000 (inclusive, with no repeats) in unsorted order. Your task is to compute the total number of comparisons used to sort the given input file by QuickSort. There are three ways to choose pivot element: the first element, the last element and the median among the first, middle and last element of the array.
  - [QuickSort](https://github.com/nguyentuanvn/Algorithm/blob/master/1.3_Quicksort.cpp) by C++

- Week 4:
  - [1.4_kargerMinCut.txt](https://github.com/nguyentuanvn/Algorithm/blob/master/1.4_kargerMinCut(17).txt) contains the adjacency list representation of a simple undirected graph. Your task is to code up and run the randomized contraction algorithm for the min cut problem and use it on the above graph to compute the min cut.
  - [MinCut](https://github.com/nguyentuanvn/Algorithm/blob/master/1.4_MinCut.cpp) by C++
